        Hi, I'm Abhishek. Developer, Student. As a MERN stack developer with a passion for coding and problem-solving, I have honed my skills through extensive practice and real-world experience. I have solved over 1300 coding problems on LeetCode and 200 on GeeksforGeeks, which has given me a strong foundation in algorithms and data structures.

With hands-on experience in developing various projects, I have become proficient in building full-stack applications with the MERN stack. I am highly skilled in using REST APIs to build scalable, secure, and efficient web applications.
